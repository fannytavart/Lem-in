# Lem-in

{EPITECH.} first year project.

This is a C anthill simulator.

## Requirements

 - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 - [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

## Compilation

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run `make` to build the `lem_in` executable file.

## Rules

 - The goal is to find the quickest way to make all the ants cross over the anthill.
 - Each single ant needs to take the shortest route, whithout walking on its peers & avoiding traffic jams.
 - At the beginning of the game, all the ants are at the anthill entrance.
 - During each lap, every ant can move only once by following a tunnel from its current room to an empty room.
 - The goal is to lead the ants to the exit room, in a minimum amount of laps.
 - Each room could contain a single ant at a time (except ##start and ##end).

## Map generator

You can generate BSQ maps using the Perl script `gen_map.pl`:

```
perl gen_map.pl [SIZE] [DENSITY] [NB_ANTS]
```
